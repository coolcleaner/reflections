1. When would you want to create a remote respository rather than keeping all your work local?

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Remote may contain changes made by other contributors, and you may not want to include those changes to your code.


3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: fork is a concept within Github which allows you to copy the contents of other people's repository to your repository. clone is a git feature which allows you to copy a repository from one place to another (local or remote). branch is a git feature which allows you to start working on some new features of your code without worrying break any functioning components.
